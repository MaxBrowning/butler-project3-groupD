# OVERVIEW

## 1.	Project Background and Description
The State of Indiana requires the filing of a sales disclosure form (SDF) whenever real property is sold. We will create applications for users to explore this data from 2020 to search locations of interest for potential property purchases as well as estimate property value through machine learning.
## 2.	Dataset:
https://www.stats.indiana.edu/topic/sdf.asp - Specific focus on 2020 data
## 3.	Inspiration:

Tools:
  - Machine Learning 
  – Predicting property value based on user input (property type, acreage, city/zip)
  - Tableau – dynamic graphs and maps
  - SQL / Postgres & Heroku deployment
